        <p>
            The Centre for Robotics & Intelligent Systems (CRIS), formerly the Mobile & Marine Robotics Research Centre
            (MMRRC), is the only research centre in Ireland dedicated to robotic applications and the development of
            marine robotics on the island. Established in 2000 at the University of Limerick, CRIS brings together a
            highly capable engineering group composed of postdoctoral researchers and PhD students from diverse
            disciplines including electronic, computer, mechanical, and aeronautical engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
            The group focuses on practical, industrially relevant marine technologies. From marine platforms to
            navigation systems, sensor development, emergency response planning, remote operated vehicle (ROV)
            technologies, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we are actively engaged in building a wide range of
            robotic systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            CRIS is an integral part of MaREI, the SFI Centre for Marine & Renewable Energy, and contributes to
            national, European, and industry-collaborative projects.
